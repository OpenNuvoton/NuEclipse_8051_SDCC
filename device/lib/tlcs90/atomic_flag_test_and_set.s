_atomic_flag_test_and_set:
	ld	de, 2 (sp)
	ld	l, #1

	sbc	hl, #0

; Previous implementation (which might be needed again in the future, see below)

;	ret
; This implementation used 0 as clear state, 1 as set state,
; which seems closer to the spirit of atomic_flag. The current
; implementation fulfills the letter of C standards up to C23.
; At the time the previous implementation was written, there were
; proposals for the C standard to allow default-initialization of atomic_flag
; to the clear state, or allow assignments to and from atomic_flag
; (with clear being 0, and set being 1). While these proposals were not
; approved by SC22 WG14 (at least for now), they would have substantially
; complicated an implementation where set is internally represented as 0.
; SC22 WG14 might still go the way of one of these proposals in the future.
; The additional burden on implementations would not be considered undue:
; e.g. implementations where floating-point zero is not represented as
; all-zero bytes already have to bear it for floating-point types.
; On by far platforms today, default-initialization of atomic_flag to clear
; just works, so the is also a risk of developers expecting it to work.
